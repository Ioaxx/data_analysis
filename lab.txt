for report u need to take notes here and add more things every week. written in overleaf. 

*introduction---> by the end of the week(10th sept)
    in LaTeX and will be peer reviewed, to be uploaded in canvas. MAX one page, but less is better
    must be in pdf

    things to add in the introduction
        !!!!!-what is matter and anti matter particle, how are they made etc. how to acces information,
         how to study this assymetry!!!!
        -the elementary particals of the standard model of everything we see around us. they are called elementary
         because they do not have any internal structure, they are cathegorised in different groups(check up the elementary 
         particles of SM picture) --> 6 quarks(12 if u add the anti quarks, works for every type of particle),
         6 leptons, 4 gauge bosons(via photons).
        - a proton consists of 3 quartks
        -everythiing has a fractional charge
        -all particles around us are made of u(up), d(down), e(electron)(leptons, they are also 6)
        -quark model introduced by Gell-Mann and zweig(1964)
        -forming composite particles--> mesons and baryons
        -probing these: with a model, Pythia, in our case.
        -Kinematics
            -the z axis is horizontally
            -every particle has its own momentul, and the momentum will have its own x y and z components
            -from those 3 numbers we can calculate stuff, such as total mometun, transverse momentul
             and the pseudo-rapidity(formulas can be found on the power point presentation)
            -


        IN CASE OVERLEAF DOESN T GET SAVED: check one note

        sources:
        https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter
        https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem


for the code also add: 
- statistical uncertainty(sqrt)
-poisson distribution(central value of the distribution and uncertainty are needed)
-variance(mean standard deviation)
significance (compare the difference based on the uncertainty)
-no of pions and antipions

on top of introduction add analysis details :
include anything important for people who read my report, from the analysis point of view.
 what we analysed, how many events, what the variables are
describe what u do. in overleaf. inlude the output of the lab2.


calculate the average of particles- the average of antiparticles

"does pythia produce more particles then antiparticles"
hypothesis: pythia produces the same amount of particles and antiparticles"
has to be in duscussion, as part of the result section"- based on difference between them and corresponding uncertainties
basing it on how far it is from 0(check distance from 0, how many sigmas away i am
 away from 0. if it s more then 3 sigma waves over 0,
then the result is significantly non 0)?
in sigma waves? wether the pions are significant, everything has to do 
with the uncertainty difference. statistic uncertainty. also change the previous parts.
difference is calculated with the average number of particles/antiparticles per file
